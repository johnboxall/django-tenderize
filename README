Note
----

There is currently a bug in this implementation - the `tender_email` cookie is set to `"<email">` instead of `<email>`. Word on the street is change to the Tender code will allow this. The Response.set_cookie() function stores cookie values as Python objects - so the email string is written as a Python string with quotes...


Info
----

Tender uses tasty cookies to log your users in.

This app includes a view like `django.contrib.auth.views.login` that in addition to logging a user in as normal, sets the cookies required by Tender. Yum.


Installation
------------

First checkout the project into a folder called `tenderize` on your python path:
git clone git@github.com:johnboxall/django-tenderize.git tenderize

Second `tenderize` to your installed apps, and add the following to `settings.py`:

# .yourdomain.com
TENDER_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.mysite.com'

# get from tender
TENDER_SECRET = "???"

# your.tenderapp.com
TENDER_DOMAIN = 'support.mysite.com'

# how long the cookies will last
TENDER_COOKIE_AGE = 1209600 # (2 weeks in seconds)

Third the following to urlpatterns in `urls.py`:

url(r'^login/$', 'tenderize.views.login_and_tenderize', name="login")
